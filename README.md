# CityPop Population Explorer
This project was built using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs), [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The source code can be found in `/app` and the primary designs can be found in `/designs`. Because fetching from the API wasn't as fast as initially thought, the app's UI differs slightly from the original designs.

### Seting up the development environment
1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:rrudling/city-pop-population-explorer.git`
3. Enter the `/app` directory inside the repository: `cd city-pop-population-explorer/app`
4. Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed (should return `v14.17.3` or similar): `node -v`
5. Install all npm dependencies: `npm install`
6. Start local development server: `npm start`
